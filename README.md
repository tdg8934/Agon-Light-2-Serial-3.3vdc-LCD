# Agon-Light-2-Serial-3.3vdc-LCD
SparkFun 3.3vdc RGB Backlight 16x2 / 20x4 LCDs communication with Agon Light 2

3.3vdc LCD communication (serial Rx/Tx) with Agon Light 2
Using Richard Turnnidge serial UART assembly/ basic code with a mini thermal receipt printer and Voice Recognition sensor, I found from SparkFun some 3.3vdc RGB backlight LCDs with 16x2 and 20x4 displays (LCD-16396) (LCD-16398).
Another reason I selected these 3.3vdc compatible LCDs is they also have connections for I2C and SPI for when Agon code drivers become available.

My basic code adaptation is still in its infancy but I proved that it works. More in the fire on this to be posted on my GitHub site repository.
